## Course Description (from Jim's website)

This course is an introduction to computer image synthesis and mathematical modeling for computer graphics applications. Topics include coordinate systems, vector and affine spaces, 2-D and 3-D transforms, projection, curves and surfaces, and animation. We work to produce photorealistic 2-D renderings of 3-D virtual scenes. To do so we we use physical modeling and simulation to mimic natural phenomena. To produce the images quickly enough for interaction, we use numeric approximation techniques and graphics hardware, and also geometric algorithms and data structures.
